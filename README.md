 👀 I'm Michael. By vocation I’m a software engineer and consultant specializing in FileMaker Pro and related technologies, full-stack web development (HTML, CSS, js, jQuery, PHP, Wordpress, MySQL, CGI scripting), MacOS & Linux administration (LAMP stack & networking, BASH, Applescript, Automator, PERL, and general platform expertise), MS Excel, and, for the putative future market millionnaires among you, TradingView Pine Script; and inventor, strictly out of necessity, of the things you see in this account. By avocation I'm a lifelong avid multi-instrumentalist musician, a [meaner guitarist](https://rick.wordpress.com/2009/05/28/tonight-live-performance-by-mike-kupietz-interview-with-cloud-archive/) than you'd expect, an [almost](https://intelligentarts.net/soundtext/)-completely-unacclaimed avant-garde composer, and a dilettantish dabbler in many other arts, some of which I have completed entire projects in. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and the saxophone 🎷.
