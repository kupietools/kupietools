- 👋 Hi, I’m @kupietools, the Github presence of Michael E. Kupietz.
- 👀 By vocation I’m a software engineer and consultant specializing in FileMaker Pro and related technologies, web development (HTML, CSS, js, jQuery, PHP, Wordpress, MySQL, CGI scripting), MacOS & Linux administration (Applescript, Automator, BASH, PERL, and general platform expertise), MS Excel, and, for the putative future market millionnaires among you, TradingView Pine Script; and inventor, strictly out of necessity, of the things you see in this account. By avocation I'm a lifelong multi-instrumentalist musician, a meaner guitarist than you'd expect, and dilettantish dabbler in many other arts. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and the saxophone 🎷.

- 📫 How to reach me: email & telephone contact info is on my professional [Certified FileMaker Pro Consultant & Full-Stack Web Developer](https://www.kupietz.com) website at kupietz.com. I'm on LinkedIn at <https://www.linkedin.com/in/kupietz/> but if I'm busy that's the last place I'll see messages, using my website contact info is better. 
- 🖼 I've recently begun showcasing my creative works (within which I include coding and web design) on [Michael Kupietz Arts+Code](https://michaelkupietz.com).
